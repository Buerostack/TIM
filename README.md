## About

TIM 2.0 (Token Identity Manager) is an advanced JWT and OAuth2 integration platform that provides comprehensive token lifecycle management and multi-provider authentication capabilities. It serves as a universal, provider-agnostic identity management solution for modern applications.

**Maintained by**: Rainer T√ºrner
**Background**: TIM 2.0 evolved from the original TARA Integration Module (TIM) initially developed by the Information System Authority of Estonia (RIA). This repository represents a complete architectural rewrite, transforming TIM into a universal platform while maintaining backward compatibility with the original TARA-focused functionality.
**Status**: Active Development

## Origin

TIM 2.0 evolved from the original TARA Integration Module (TIM) that was initially developed by the Information System Authority of Estonia (RIA) under the leadership of [Rainer T√ºrner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rainer-t%C3%BCrner-058b80b8/). The original TIM was designed specifically for integration with Estonia's national e-authentication service TARA.

This repository represents a complete architectural rewrite, transforming TIM into a universal, provider-agnostic JWT and OAuth2 integration platform while maintaining backward compatibility with the original TARA-focused functionality.

**Original Architect & Current Tech Lead**: [Rainer T√ºrner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rainer-t%C3%BCrner-058b80b8/)
**Code Generation**: Assisted by Claude Code (Anthropic)

## Current Repository

TIM 2.0 is maintained as an independent project, expanding beyond its Estonian government origins to serve as a comprehensive token identity management solution for organizations worldwide. The platform maintains its core security principles while adding enterprise-grade features and multi-provider support.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Java 17+ (for local development)

### Running with Docker
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Buerostack/TIM.git
cd TIM
docker-compose up -d
```

### Access the API
- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8085
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8085/auth/health
- **Public Keys (JWKS)**: http://localhost:8085/jwt/keys/public

### Generate Your First Token
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/jwt/custom/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "JWTName": "test-token",
    "content": {
      "sub": "user123",
      "role": "admin"
    },
    "expirationInMinutes": 60
  }'
```

### Test Authentication
```bash
# Use the token from previous step
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/jwt/custom/list/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
