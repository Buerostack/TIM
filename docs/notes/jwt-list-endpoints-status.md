# JWT List Endpoints - Development Status

## ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT PRODUCTION READY

The JWT listing endpoints are currently in **development/testing phase** and require further validation before production use.

## Endpoints Status

### `/jwt/custom/list/me`
- **Status**: üü° **TESTING REQUIRED**
- **Functionality**: Lists JWTs for the authenticated user (based on Bearer token subject)
- **Implementation**: Basic functionality working
- **Issues**: Needs comprehensive testing for edge cases, security validation, and performance

### `/jwt/custom/list/admin`
- **Status**: üî¥ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- **Functionality**: Intended for administrative listing of all JWTs (cross-user)
- **Implementation**: Not yet developed
- **Security Concerns**: Requires proper admin authentication and authorization mechanisms

## What Needs Testing

### For `/jwt/custom/list/me`:
1. **Security Testing**
   - Token validation edge cases
   - Invalid/expired/revoked Bearer tokens
   - Cross-user access prevention

2. **Functionality Testing**
   - Pagination with various parameters
   - Date filtering (issued_after, issued_before, expires_after, expires_before)
   - Status filtering (active, expired, revoked)
   - Large result sets performance

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Malformed Authorization headers
   - Tokens without subject claims
   - Database connection failures
   - Concurrent access scenarios

### For `/jwt/custom/list/admin`:
1. **Design & Implementation**
   - Admin authentication mechanism
   - Authorization checks
   - Cross-user listing capabilities
   - Admin-specific filtering options

2. **Security Model**
   - Admin role verification
   - Audit logging for admin access
   - Rate limiting for admin operations

## Production Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests with various scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing with large datasets
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Error handling and logging validation
- [ ] Documentation completion
- [ ] Admin endpoint implementation and testing

## Notes

- Current implementation focuses on basic functionality
- Security model needs review before production deployment
- Performance optimization may be required for large-scale deployments
- Admin endpoint design pending - requires architecture decisions
