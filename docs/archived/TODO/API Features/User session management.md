# User Session Management

## User Story
**AS A** web application integrating with TIM
**I WANT TO** manage user sessions with proper lifecycle controls
**SO THAT** I can provide secure login/logout functionality and session monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Session Creation and Tracking
- [ ] Create session records for TARA-authenticated users
- [ ] Link JWT tokens to session identifiers
- [ ] Track session metadata (IP, user agent, login time)
- [ ] Support multiple concurrent sessions per user
- [ ] Session timeout and idle detection

### AC2: Session Logout
