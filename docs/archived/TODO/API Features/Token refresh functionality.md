# Token Refresh Functionality

## User Story
**AS A** long-running service or application
**I WANT TO** refresh JWT tokens before they expire
**SO THAT** I can maintain continuous access without user re-authentication

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Refresh Token Generation
- [ ] Option to generate refresh tokens alongside access tokens
- [ ] Longer expiration time for refresh tokens (e.g., 7 days vs 1 hour)
- [ ] Secure storage and binding between access and refresh tokens
- [ ] Different signing or encryption for refresh tokens
- [ ] Configurable refresh token lifetime

### AC2: Token Refresh Endpoint
- [ ] `POST /jwt/refresh` accepts valid refresh token
- [ ] Generate new access token with same claims
- [ ] Optionally issue new refresh token (rotation)
- [ ] Invalidate old refresh token when rotation enabled
- [ ] Preserve original token metadata and subject

### AC3: Refresh Token Validation
- [ ] Verify refresh token signature and expiration
- [ ] Check refresh token against denylist
- [ ] Validate original access token relationship
- [ ] Ensure refresh token hasn't been used if single-use policy
- [ ] Rate limiting on refresh operations

### AC4: Security Considerations
- [ ] Refresh token rotation to prevent replay attacks
- [ ] Bind refresh tokens to specific clients or sessions
- [ ] Revoke refresh token family on suspicious activity
- [ ] Audit logging of all refresh operations
- [ ] Secure transmission and storage requirements

### AC5: TARA Token Refresh
- [ ] Handle refresh for TARA-authenticated sessions
- [ ] Integration with TARA refresh token flow if available
- [ ] Fallback to re-authentication if TARA refresh fails
- [ ] Preserve TARA-specific claims in refreshed tokens
- [ ] Session management for TARA tokens

### AC6: Configuration and Policies
- [ ] Configurable refresh token lifetime
- [ ] Policy for refresh token rotation
- [ ] Maximum number of refreshes per original token
- [ ] Grace period for overlapping token validity
- [ ] Different policies for custom vs TARA tokens
