# Rate Limiting for Token Generation

## User Story
**AS A** security engineer
**I WANT TO** implement rate limiting on token generation endpoints
**SO THAT** I can prevent abuse, brute force attacks, and resource exhaustion

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Request Rate Limiting
- [ ] Limit requests per IP address (e.g., 100 requests/hour)
- [ ] Limit requests per authenticated client (e.g., 1000 requests/hour)
- [ ] Different limits for custom JWT vs TARA endpoints
- [ ] Configurable rate limit thresholds and time windows
- [ ] Exponential backoff for repeated violations

### AC2: Token Generation Limits
- [ ] Limit number of active tokens per subject
- [ ] Limit token generation frequency per user/client
- [ ] Different limits based on token type and expiration
- [ ] Grace period for legitimate high-frequency use cases
- [ ] Override capabilities for administrative operations

### AC3: Rate Limiting Implementation
- [ ] In-memory rate limiting with Redis or similar
- [ ] Distributed rate limiting for multiple TIM instances
- [ ] Sliding window algorithm for accurate rate tracking
- [ ] Efficient storage and cleanup of rate limit data
- [ ] Fast lookup and update operations

### AC4: Response and Error Handling
- [ ] HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) for rate limit violations
- [ ] Include retry-after header with reset time
- [ ] Clear error messages about rate limits
- [ ] Gradual rate limit enforcement (warnings before blocking)
- [ ] Logging of rate limit violations for monitoring

### AC5: Configuration and Management
- [ ] Environment-specific rate limit configurations
- [ ] Runtime configuration updates without restart
- [ ] Whitelist/blacklist for rate limiting bypass
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting on rate limit violations
- [ ] Analytics on rate limiting effectiveness

### AC6: Advanced Protection
- [ ] IP reputation-based rate limiting
- [ ] Behavioral analysis for anomaly detection
- [ ] Progressive penalties for repeat offenders
- [ ] Integration with Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- [ ] DDoS protection coordination
