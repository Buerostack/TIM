# CORS Configuration

## User Story
**AS A** web application developer
**I WANT TO** have proper CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration
**SO THAT** my frontend applications can securely access TIM APIs from different domains

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: CORS Policy Configuration
- [ ] Configure allowed origins for cross-origin requests
- [ ] Specify allowed HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- [ ] Define allowed headers for CORS requests
- [ ] Set appropriate exposed headers in responses
- [ ] Configure credentials support for authenticated requests

### AC2: Environment-Specific CORS
- [ ] Different CORS policies for development, staging, production
- [ ] Whitelist specific domains for production deployment
- [ ] Wildcard origins only for development environments
- [ ] Configurable CORS settings via application properties
- [ ] Runtime CORS configuration updates

### AC3: Security Considerations
- [ ] Prevent overly permissive CORS configurations
- [ ] Validate origin headers against allowed domains
- [ ] Proper handling of preflight OPTIONS requests
- [ ] Protection against CORS-based attacks
- [ ] Audit logging of CORS policy violations

### AC4: API-Specific CORS Rules
- [ ] Different CORS policies for different API endpoints
- [ ] More restrictive CORS for sensitive operations
- [ ] Public endpoints with relaxed CORS (e.g., public keys)
- [ ] Administrative endpoints with strict CORS
- [ ] Token generation endpoints with appropriate CORS

### AC5: Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Support for modern browser CORS implementations
- [ ] Graceful handling of legacy browser limitations
- [ ] Proper handling of complex requests requiring preflight
- [ ] Support for credentials and authentication headers
- [ ] Testing across different browser implementations

### AC6: Monitoring and Debugging
- [ ] Logging of CORS requests and responses
- [ ] Metrics on CORS usage and violations
- [ ] Debug headers for CORS troubleshooting
- [ ] Documentation for frontend developers
- [ ] Tools for testing CORS configuration

### AC7: Integration with Security Headers
- [ ] Coordination with Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Integration with other security headers
- [ ] Protection against clickjacking and XSS
- [ ] Secure cookie handling with CORS
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement for cross-origin requests
