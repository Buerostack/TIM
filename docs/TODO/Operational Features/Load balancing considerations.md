# Load Balancing Considerations

## User Story
**AS A** DevOps engineer
**I WANT TO** deploy TIM with proper load balancing
**SO THAT** I can ensure high availability, scalability, and optimal resource utilization

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Load Balancer Configuration
- [ ] Support for multiple TIM instances behind load balancer
- [ ] Health check endpoints for load balancer probes
- [ ] Session affinity considerations for stateful operations
- [ ] Proper handling of client IP forwarding
- [ ] SSL termination and passthrough options

### AC2: Stateless Application Design
- [ ] Remove server-side session dependencies
- [ ] Externalize session state to shared storage (Redis)
- [ ] Stateless JWT validation and generation
- [ ] Database-backed state for OAuth flows
- [ ] Shared configuration across instances

### AC3: Database Connection Management
- [ ] Connection pooling across multiple instances
- [ ] Database connection limits and resource sharing
- [ ] Read replica support for read-heavy operations
- [ ] Connection failover and retry logic
- [ ] Database load balancing for high availability

### AC4: Caching Strategy
- [ ] Shared caching layer (Redis) for multiple instances
- [ ] Cache invalidation across instances
- [ ] JWT public key caching
- [ ] Rate limiting data sharing
- [ ] Session data caching for performance

### AC5: Configuration Management
- [ ] Centralized configuration for all instances
- [ ] Dynamic configuration updates without restart
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration deployment
- [ ] Secret management across instances
- [ ] Feature flag management for rolling deployments

### AC6: Monitoring and Observability
- [ ] Load balancer metrics and health monitoring
- [ ] Instance-level performance monitoring
- [ ] Distributed tracing across instances
- [ ] Aggregate logging and correlation
- [ ] Canary deployment monitoring

### AC7: High Availability and Failover
- [ ] Multi-zone deployment for disaster recovery
- [ ] Automatic failover for unhealthy instances
- [ ] Graceful shutdown procedures
- [ ] Circuit breaker patterns for dependencies
- [ ] Recovery procedures for partial outages
