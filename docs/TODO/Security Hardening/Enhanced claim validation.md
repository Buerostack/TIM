# Enhanced Claim Validation

## User Story
**AS A** security administrator
**I WANT TO** validate JWT claims against security policies and business rules
**SO THAT** I can ensure tokens contain appropriate data and prevent security vulnerabilities

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Claim Schema Validation
- [ ] Define JSON schemas for allowed claim structures
- [ ] Validate custom claims against predefined schemas
- [ ] Reject tokens with invalid or unexpected claim formats
- [ ] Support different schemas for different token types
- [ ] Configurable validation rules per client or use case

### AC2: Claim Value Validation
- [ ] Validate claim values against allowed lists or patterns
- [ ] Check email format, phone number format, etc.
- [ ] Ensure numeric claims are within acceptable ranges
- [ ] Validate date/time claims for reasonable values
- [ ] Custom validation rules for business-specific claims

### AC3: Security Claim Checks
- [ ] Validate issuer claim matches expected TIM identifier
- [ ] Ensure audience claim is appropriate for requesting service
- [ ] Check subject claim format and uniqueness
- [ ] Validate expiration times are within policy limits
- [ ] Prevent injection attacks through claim validation

### AC4: TARA-Specific Claim Validation
- [ ] Validate Estonian personal codes (isikukood) format
- [ ] Check authentication method against allowed methods
- [ ] Validate level of assurance claims
- [ ] Ensure required TARA claims are present
- [ ] Cross-validate claims for consistency

### AC5: Custom Validation Rules
- [ ] Configurable validation rules via configuration files
- [ ] Regular expression patterns for custom claim formats
- [ ] Business rule validation (e.g., age restrictions)
- [ ] Cross-claim validation dependencies
- [ ] Runtime rule updates without service restart

### AC6: Error Handling and Reporting
- [ ] Detailed validation error messages
- [ ] Specific error codes for different validation failures
- [ ] Logging of validation errors for monitoring
- [ ] Security alerts for suspicious validation patterns
- [ ] User-friendly error messages without security details

### AC7: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Efficient validation algorithms
- [ ] Caching of validation rules and schemas
- [ ] Parallel validation of independent claims
- [ ] Early termination on first validation failure
- [ ] Monitoring of validation performance impact
