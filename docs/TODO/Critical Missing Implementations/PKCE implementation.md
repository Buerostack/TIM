# PKCE Implementation

## User Story
**AS A** security engineer
**I WANT TO** implement PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) in the TARA OAuth2 flow
**SO THAT** the authorization code exchange is protected against interception attacks

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Code Verifier Generation
- [ ] Generate cryptographically secure random code verifier (43-128 characters)
- [ ] Use URL-safe base64 encoding without padding
- [ ] Store code verifier securely in OAuth state table
- [ ] Ensure code verifier is unique per authorization request

### AC2: Code Challenge Creation
- [ ] Generate code challenge from verifier using SHA256
- [ ] Use base64url encoding for challenge
- [ ] Include code_challenge and code_challenge_method=S256 in authorization URL
- [ ] Validate challenge format before sending to TARA

### AC3: Token Exchange Verification
- [ ] Include original code verifier in token exchange request
- [ ] TARA validates verifier matches the challenge
- [ ] Remove code verifier from database after successful exchange
- [ ] Handle PKCE validation errors from TARA

### AC4: Security Compliance
- [ ] Code verifier has sufficient entropy (minimum 256 bits)
- [ ] Verifier is only used once per authorization flow
- [ ] Verifier is not exposed in logs or client-side code
- [ ] Implementation follows RFC 7636 specification
