# Allowlist/Denylist Enforcement

## User Story
**AS A** security administrator
**I WANT TO** enforce allowlist and denylist rules during token generation and validation
**SO THAT** I can control which tokens and subjects are permitted in the system

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Denylist Enforcement in Token Generation
- [ ] Check subject against denylist before generating custom JWTs
- [ ] Prevent token generation for denylisted subjects
- [ ] Check existing token hash against denylist
- [ ] Return appropriate error when generation is blocked
- [ ] Apply to both custom and TARA token generation

### AC2: Allowlist Enforcement (When Enabled)
- [ ] Check if allowlist mode is enabled via configuration
- [ ] Verify subject exists in allowlist before token generation
- [ ] Allow token generation only for explicitly allowed subjects
- [ ] Support both subject-based and token-hash-based allowlisting
- [ ] Graceful handling when allowlist is empty

### AC3: Validation-Time Enforcement
- [ ] Check token hash against denylist during validation
- [ ] Verify subject is not in subject-based denylist
- [ ] Apply allowlist rules during token introspection
- [ ] Fast lookup using database indexes
- [ ] Return specific error codes for blocked tokens

### AC4: Rule Priority and Logic
- [ ] Denylist takes precedence over allowlist
- [ ] Subject-based rules apply to all tokens for that subject
- [ ] Token-specific rules only affect individual tokens
- [ ] Expired denylist entries are ignored
- [ ] Clear error messages for different blocking reasons

### AC5: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Cache frequently accessed denylist entries
- [ ] Use efficient database queries with proper indexes
- [ ] Batch processing for multiple token checks
- [ ] Minimize database calls during validation
- [ ] Monitor and optimize query performance

### AC6: Administrative Interface
- [ ] Endpoints to manage allowlist/denylist entries
- [ ] Bulk import/export of allow/deny rules
- [ ] Query current status of subjects or tokens
- [ ] Audit trail for list modifications
- [ ] Validation of rule formats and conflicts
