# Bulk Token Operations

## User Story
**AS AN** administrator managing many tokens
**I WANT TO** perform operations on multiple tokens simultaneously
**SO THAT** I can efficiently manage large numbers of tokens without individual API calls

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Bulk Token Generation
- [ ] `POST /jwt/custom/generate/bulk` accepts array of token requests
- [ ] Process multiple token generations in single transaction
- [ ] Return array of responses with individual success/failure status
- [ ] Support different expiration times and claims per token
- [ ] Validate all requests before processing any

### AC2: Bulk Token Validation
- [ ] `POST /jwt/validate/bulk` accepts array of tokens
- [ ] Validate multiple tokens efficiently in parallel
- [ ] Return validation status for each token
- [ ] Optimize database queries for batch processing
- [ ] Handle partial failures gracefully

### AC3: Bulk Token Revocation
- [ ] `POST /jwt/revoke/bulk` revokes multiple tokens
- [ ] Support revocation by token values or IDs
- [ ] Add all tokens to denylist in single transaction
- [ ] Return revocation status for each token
- [ ] Include reason field for batch revocations

### AC4: Performance and Limits
- [ ] Configurable maximum batch size (e.g., 100 tokens)
- [ ] Efficient database operations with proper batching
- [ ] Timeout handling for large batches
- [ ] Progress tracking for long-running operations
- [ ] Memory-efficient processing of large requests

### AC5: Error Handling and Reporting
- [ ] Individual error reporting for each token in batch
- [ ] Continue processing on individual failures
- [ ] Detailed error messages with token identification
- [ ] Summary statistics in response
- [ ] Rollback entire batch on critical failures

### AC6: Administrative Features
- [ ] Bulk export of token metadata
- [ ] Bulk import of allowlist/denylist entries
- [ ] Bulk cleanup operations
- [ ] Progress monitoring for administrative operations
- [ ] Audit logging for bulk operations
