# Token Introspection Endpoints

## User Story
**AS A** service that receives JWT tokens
**I WANT TO** query detailed information about tokens through introspection endpoints
**SO THAT** I can make authorization decisions based on token metadata and claims

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: RFC 7662 Compliance
- [ ] `POST /oauth2/introspect` endpoint following RFC 7662 standard
- [ ] Accept token in request body as form parameter
- [ ] Return standardized response with active, exp, iat, scope fields
- [ ] Support both custom and TARA-issued tokens
- [ ] Include token-specific claims in response

### AC2: Extended Introspection Information
- [ ] Include custom claims from original token generation
- [ ] Return token metadata (issuer, audience, subject)
- [ ] Provide token type (custom vs TARA)
- [ ] Show remaining time until expiration
- [ ] Include authentication method for TARA tokens

### AC3: Security and Access Control
- [ ] Validate calling service has permission to introspect
- [ ] Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] Audit logging of introspection requests
- [ ] No sensitive information in error responses
- [ ] Token value not returned in response

### AC4: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Fast response for invalid or expired tokens
- [ ] Cache frequently introspected tokens
- [ ] Efficient database queries for token metadata
- [ ] Batch introspection support for multiple tokens
- [ ] Async processing for non-critical metadata

### AC5: Error Handling
- [ ] Clear error codes for different failure types
- [ ] Graceful handling of malformed tokens
- [ ] Database connectivity error handling
- [ ] Timeout handling for slow operations
- [ ] Standardized error response format
